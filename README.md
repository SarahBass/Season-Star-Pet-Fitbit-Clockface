Fitbit clock filled with cute interactions, daily changing pictures, and fun surprises.

## DESCRIPTION:
Updated for Versa 3 & Sense, this clock is filled with cute interactions, daily changing pictures, and fun surprises.

Have fun exercising as this little star swirls around on your watch, and interacts with you all day. The star brushes its teeth, eats healthy food, works out, and goes to bed with a little teddy bear based on preset times. The star also plays an instrument, plays soccer, sun bathes, reads, goes to work, calls friends, watches movies, and more. He may fall asleep if you are not in movement, but will wake right back up and start floating again in a minute. Floating all day is tiring work.

This clock also has holiday modes automatically set for Christmas, Thanksgiving, Halloween, Easter, Saint Patrick's Day, and more. It also has monthly changes, showing winter backgrounds during January and December, Spring, Summer, and Fall. It also has dozens of night sky and colorful backgrounds. These are randomly selected per day from 120 backgrounds, 10 new backgrounds each month.

When you reach your goal, the star will change form selecting randomly from a library of 40 characters: 10 spring characters(Easter, St.Patrick, and baby animal), 10 winter characters (Snow, Christmas, and Hanukkah), 10 spooky characters, and 10 colorful stars.

Settings: If set active, goal, and calorie permissions are not turned on, it will print "NAN" or "0". Heart Rate activated when you click Star, click again to turn off to save battery.
